Here we enclose data and scripts used to obtain the results from the manuscript "Sampling Bias and Model Choice in Continuous Phylogeography: Getting Lost on a Random Walk" by Antanas Kalkauskas, Umperto Perron, Yuxuan Sun, Guy Baele, Nick Goldman, Stephan Guindon and Nicola De Maio.

Please refer to the Guide.pdf file in folder Guide_to_code on how to run simulations.

"WNV" and "YFV" folders contain files for replicating the West Nile Virus and Yellow Fever Virus analyses respectively.

"python_scripts" and "bash_scripts" foldesr contain scripts for replicating the analyses of BMP simulations.
"discmodel" folders contains files for replicatinf the discsim simulations and inference.
"templates" contains template files for BEAST and PhyREX used for simulated datasets.

"plots" contains scripts used to plot the results from simulations and real data analyses.
